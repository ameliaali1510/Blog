Bootcamp Blog App

For my final bootcamp project, my team developed a full-stack blogging platform to demonstrate our ability to build complete web applications. The platform includes a database to create, read, update, and delete blog posts (fulfilling the full CRUD functionality), as well as user authentication features such as registration and login, with user details securely stored in a separate database. We also placed a strong focus on front-end design to ensure the site was both visually appealing and user-friendly.

To showcase the project, Iâ€™ve included a screenshot of the app interface as well as a short video demo highlighting its main features and functionality in the Images folder.
